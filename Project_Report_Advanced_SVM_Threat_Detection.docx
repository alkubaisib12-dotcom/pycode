1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This project addresses the critical challenge of automated network threat detection in modern cybersecurity operations. With network traffic volumes exceeding manual analysis capabilities, machine learning offers a scalable solution for real-time threat identification and classification.

We developed an advanced Support Vector Machine (SVM) based threat detection system that achieves exceptional accuracy in classifying network flows into three categories: Normal traffic, Network Attacks, and Malware/Code Attacks. The system employs comprehensive data preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, and extensive hyperparameter optimization to maximize detection performance.

================================================================================
5. DATA PREPROCESSING PIPELINE
================================================================================

Our preprocessing pipeline implements a comprehensive multi-stage approach:

Stage 1: Data Cleaning
- Removed identifier columns (Flow ID, IP addresses, Timestamp)
  Rationale: Non-predictive features that could cause overfitting
- Removed zero-variance features (9 columns)
  Rationale: Features with all zeros provide no discriminative information
- Handled infinite values by replacing with NaN, then median imputation
  Rationale: Prevents computational errors while preserving data distribution

Stage 2: Label Engineering
Consolidated 11 original attack categories into 3 main threat classes:

Class 1: Normal (3,385 samples)
  - Benign traffic
  - Analysis activities
  Rationale: Legitimate network operations

Class 2: Network_Attacks (15,000 samples)
  - DoS, Exploits, Generic, Fuzzers, Reconnaissance
  Rationale: Traffic-based attack patterns targeting network infrastructure

Class 3: Malware_CodeAttacks (2,800 samples)
  - Backdoor, Shellcode, Worms
  Rationale: Code-based threats involving malicious payload delivery

This grouping improves:
- Model learning by increasing samples per class
- Operational relevance for security teams
- Classification accuracy through clearer decision boundaries

Stage 3: Outlier Detection and Removal
Method: Isolation Forest (contamination=0.05)
- Detected and removed ~5% of samples as outliers
- Prevents model distortion from anomalous data points
- Improves overall model generalization

Outliers removed: ~1,059 samples
Clean dataset: ~20,126 samples

Stage 4: Feature Variance and Correlation Analysis
- Applied Variance Threshold (threshold=0.01)
  Removed low-variance features contributing minimal information

- Correlation Analysis (threshold=0.95)
  Identified and removed highly correlated features (r > 0.95)
  Rationale: Reduces multicollinearity and computational overhead

Stage 5: Train-Test Split
- Split Ratio: 75% training, 25% testing
- Stratification: Maintained class proportions
- Random State: 42 (for reproducibility)
- Final Split: ~15,095 training, ~5,031 testing samples

================================================================================
6. FEATURE ENGINEERING AND SELECTION
================================================================================

Advanced Feature Engineering Techniques:

- Fwd_Bwd_Packet_Ratio = Forward Packets / (Backward Packets + 1)
  Insight: Attack traffic often shows unusual forward/backward ratios

- Packet_Rate = Total Packets / (Flow Duration + 1)
  Insight: DDoS attacks exhibit abnormally high packet rates

- Bwd_Packet_Rate = Backward Packets / (Flow Duration + 1)
  Insight: Certain attacks generate minimal server responses

- Benefits: Improves SVM kernel performance and decision boundary learning
- Example: Log1p transformation for byte counts, packet lengths

3. Square Root Transformations
Applied to high-variance features:
- Purpose: Variance stabilization for features with extreme outliers
- Benefits: Reduces influence of extreme values while preserving relationships

Feature Selection Strategy:

Method 1: Variance Threshold
- Removed features with variance < 0.01
- Eliminated 15+ low-information features

Method 2: Correlation-based Filtering
- Computed pairwise correlation matrix
- Removed features with correlation > 0.95
- Reduced multicollinearity and redundancy

Method 3: SelectKBest (Mutual Information)
Tested multiple k values: [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 'all']
- Scoring Function: Mutual Information Classification
  Rationale: Captures non-linear relationships between features and labels
- Optimal k determined through cross-validation
